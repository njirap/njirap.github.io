        This series of tutorial links is intended to be a self-paced strong introduction to and
        foundation in Software Engineering. All the tutorials have been vetted for simplicity
        and not requiring much local machine investment from your end, i.e you may not require to
        install complex libraries and/or software in order to follow the tutorial as the links
        should have online 'try it yourself' environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        The expectation from you is that you can follow these tutorials at the end of which you
        can book some time with us(myself and/or my friend(s)) to review your work and get feedback
        on the same. This is the link you can follow to pick an available time slot(link coming soon)
    </p>
    <p>
        Be encouraged to be self-driven, passionate and maintain your fire.
        We wish you all the best.
